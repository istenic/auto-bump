An Auto-Bump bot for disboard, the server site for discord.. 
It sends !d bump to a desired channel approximately every 2 hours.
IN THE LINE 4 AND 5 EDIT SERVER ID AND CHANNEL ID TO YOUR DESIRED SERVER AND CHANNEL WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE SENDING IT.
Do it like with any other bot, all the npm init and things. If you dont know how, watch any tutorial on how to create a Hello World bot. After all in the tutorial is done, paste the index.js to the folder youre doing this in, and do sudo apt-get install cron for linux and npm install cron for windows.


EDIT THE FILE AND IN THE BOTTOM REPLACE "yourtoken" WITH YOUR BOT/ACCOUNT TOKEN
You need to install NPM, Node, discord.js ("discord.js-selfbot" if you do it with a self bot, then you also have to edit the code to const Discord = require('discord.js-selfbot'); ), and cron. 
This is probably in some way against discord TOS so use at your own risk
The code is probably shit, im new to discord.js.
