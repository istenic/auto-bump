An Auto-Bump bot for disboard, the server site for discord.. 
EDIT THE FILE AND IN THE BOTTOM REPLACE "yourtoken" WITH YOUR BOT/ACCOUNT TOKEN
You need to install NPM, Node, discord.js ("discord.js-selfbot" if you do it with a self bot, then you also have to edit the code to const Discord = require('discord.js-selfbot'); ), and cron. 
The code is probably shit, im new to discord.js
